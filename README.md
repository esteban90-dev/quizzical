# Quizzical

This is a React app that quizzes the user on 5 random trivia questions.  
The user selects his/her answer for each question and then clicks the 
'Check answers' button to have the quiz scored.  After the quiz has been
scored, the user can click the 'Play again' button and a new quiz will be
generated with 5 new questions.

This app is the final project from Scrimba's [Learn React course.](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)
The trivia questions are polled from the [Open Trivia Database.](https://opentdb.com/)
